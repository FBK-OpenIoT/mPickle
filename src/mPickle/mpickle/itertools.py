"""
This file is based on the itertools module from micropython-lib:
https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/blob/01047889eb1acf115424fee293e03769f6916393/python-stdlib/itertools/itertools.py

All functions except `islice` are identical to the original module. The `islice` function has been adapted with some 
improvements:
1. Simplified argument parsing to handle variable-length arguments (start, stop, step) more effectively.
2. Added input validation to raise a ValueError for invalid inputs, such as negative values for start, stop, and step.
3. Introduced support for open-ended slices (stop=None) to allow for infinite iterables.
4. Optimized the iteration process to make the code cleaner and more efficient.
